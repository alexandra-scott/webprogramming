        <h2>API Information</h2>
        <p>The Gender API predicts the gender of a given first name and reports 
        the probability of that name being associated with that gender and the number 
        of examples the data is based on. In addition, it can also take into account 
        the country of origin.</p>
        <p>I found this API on the website provided on Canvas: 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/">
                https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/<a> 
        </p>
        <p>The option I used for the API request was name=alexandra and country_id=US. 
            Some of the other things I tried were other names and experimenting with 
        how using countr_id=US significantly decreased the number for count.</p>
        <p>This API would be helpful on an a website that lists baby names based 
            on gender. Another potential applicaiton is in translation services, 
        when they are trying to determine which pronouns to use in ambiguous cases, you 
    could consult this API, which would give predictions of gender based on </p>
